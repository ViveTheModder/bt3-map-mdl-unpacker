# bt3-map-mdl-unpacker
A modding tool for the PS2 version of DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3 that exports one or all sections of the ``00_map_main_data.mdl`` file within any map PAK.

The tool also works for custom maps like those from [Kinnikuchu's site](https://kinnikuchu.com/mods), not just other vanilla/modified maps.

Currently, the supported languages are English, German, Italian and Portuguese (Brazilian).

This may not be the case for most of Kinnikuchu's maps, but they will often have the tool pop up this error message:
