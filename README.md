# bt3-map-mdl-unpacker
A modding tool for the PS2 version of DBZ Budokai Tenkaichi 3 that exports one or all sections of the ``00_map_main_data.mdl`` file within any map PAK.

The tool also works for custom maps like those from Kinnikuchu's site, not just other vanilla/modified maps.
# Demonstration
## CLI
To run the tool from the command line, add ``-c`` as an argument.

This may not be the case for most of Kinnikuchu's maps, but they will often have the tool pop up this error message:
